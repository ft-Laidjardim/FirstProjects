My First Programming Projects

Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository contains some of the first projects I developed, with a focus on the C language, as part of my programming learning journey. These projects mark the early stages of my journey as a programmer and serve as a demonstration of what I have learned so far.
About

These projects were fundamental to my development as a programmer and were the starting point for learning C, one of the most powerful and essential languages in the programming world.

Through each project, I gained a better understanding of how computational systems work and honed my skills in solving complex problems through code. During this process, I learned the importance of writing clean and efficient code, as well as strengthening my problem-solving skills to tackle increasingly difficult challenges.
